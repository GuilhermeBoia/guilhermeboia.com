One of the things I was most curious about during our batch was how life would be after Demo Day.

## The Journey Continues

I compiled some of the learnings from my own experience and asked other Y Combinator friends from various batches, so you can get a feel of what happens after YC.

> Many founders look back at their YC journey as the fastest and most intense period of their startup journey, which is ironic because you usually attend YC in the first 1 year.

I thought that after YC, things would calm down, but it was quite the opposite.

## Code Example

```javascript
const example = () => {
  console.log("Hello YC!");
};
```

# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! My name is Guilherme Boia, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student from Brazil, at Universidade Federal de Campina Grande. I'm starting this website to share with you guys my thoughts, projects, and journey.

Expect posts about programming, tech tips, and maybe a little bit of life. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy whatâ€™s to come!

Stay tuned for more updates soon!
